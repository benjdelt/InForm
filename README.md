# InForm
InForm is a custom form builder and document management system for trades companies.

Using an intuitive drag and drop interface, users can build tailored form templates for their employees to fill out. After they've been submitted the relevant managers and foremen can view these and stay up to date.

Upon logging in, managers are directed to their dashboard - providing a high level overview of the most relevant information they need to see each day.

Additionally they can view and search the employee database, keeping up to date with contact information, form submissions and hours worked during their selected calendar period.

Each page is also features a global search bar to enhance the user experience and provide relevant information as quickly as possible.
